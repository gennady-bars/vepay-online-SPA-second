Это наиболее распространённый вариант использования платёжной формы — с проведением оплат в одну стадию, при которых в рамках одного сеанса работы Vepay осуществляется разовый перевод денежных средств от пользователя к продавцу, например за совершаемую покупку.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <h3>\r\n            Холдирование средств.\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n            При таком варианте использования в рамках сеанса работы Vepay осуществляется блокировка денежных средств на счёте пользователя, и продавец получает возможность уже в дальнейшем списать нужную сумму или вернуть деньги пользователю. Имея данную возможность, не нужно оформлять возврат, достаточно просто не списывать замороженные средства.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <h3>Регулярные платежи.</h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n            Данная возможность дает компаниям списывать средства с банковской карты клиента без дополнительного подтверждения каждой транзакции (безакцептные платежи). Рекарринговые платежи экономят время клиента — достаточно один раз указать данные банковской карты и платежи будут проходить автоматически. Это осуществляется с помощью получения токена карты, который формируется в платежном шлюзе и передается продавцу для последующих автоплатежей.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <h3>Регистрация карты на платёжном шлюзе (привязка).</h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n            Данная операция используется для регистрации (привязки) карты стороннего Банка в системе платёжного шлюза. Данный метод используется в рамках осуществления списания с карт сторонних Банков, в том числе, рекуррентных платежей, проверки принадлежности ее клиенту. При регистрации карты, с нее списывается и сразу возвращается определенная сумма, указанная продавцом. клиенту при вводе данных на форме сумма не показывается. После проведения операции клиент может быть возвращен на сайт продавца, адрес которого передается в запросе. На сайте продавца клиенту необходимо ввести сумму, списанную с карты. Если сумма совпадет с той, что была передана в начале операции - продавец в своей системе помечает карту как привязанную.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <h3>\r\n            Callback Service.\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n            Для получения статуса по осуществлению операций по картам через платёжный шлюз, можно использовать механизм оповещений.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            Во-первых, программные оповещения, которые автоматически отправляются на заданные URL по итогам выполнения целевых действий и содержат детальную информацию о результатах. Через эти оповещения можно обеспечивать оперативный автоматический контроль ситуации на стороне серверной части веб-сервиса.\r\nВ-вторых, средства интерфейса Личного Кабинета, с помощью которого можно обеспечивать контроль и анализ ситуации сотрудниками, как по отдельным платежам, так и по сводным показателям.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <h1>\r\n            Функциональность платёжной формы (виджета).\r\n            </h1>\r\n            <h3>Способы вызова формы.</h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n            Вызов Vepay из веб-сервиса может быть реализован как через переход по кнопке, так и через другие интерфейсные события.

Для таких перенаправлений могут использоваться варианты с отдельной HTML-страницей (в текущей или новой вкладке браузера) и с объектом iframe в HTML-странице.

Время рассмотрения платежей Расчетным центром банка до 3х рабочих дней с 9-18ч. Если платеж пришел позже, то он может быть перенесен на следующий день. Также задержка может быть обусловлена техническими проблемами на стороне банка или Расчетного центра.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Что делать</strong>: напишите письмо на support@vepay.online с описанием проблемы и мы уточним статус платежа.</p>\r\n<h2>500x ошибка.</h2>\r\n<p>Если после запроса к нашему серверу транзакция вернулась с 500х ошибкой, это означает, что она в обработку не поступила из за технических проблем на стороне нашего сервера или клиента. На обработку в банк такие транзакции не попадают. Мы заранее информируем клиентов о проведении плановых технических работ на нашей стороне и на стороне банка, но от внеплановых технических сбоев никто не застрахован. Проверьте свою сетевую инфраструктуру на корректную работоспособность.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Что делать</strong>: Если проблем не выявлено, напишите письмо на support@vepay.online с описанием проблемы и уточнения статуса нашего сервера.</p>\r\n<h2>Задвоение платежей.</h2>\r\n<p>Задвоение встречается, если есть несколько транзакций с одинаковыми vepayid или extid. В таком случае успешно проведена будет только 1 транзакция, а остальные при попадании в пулл банка на обработку должны быть отменены нашей системой. На обработку в банк такие транзакции не попадают.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Что делать</strong>: напишите письмо на support@vepay.online с описанием проблемы для уточнения статуса по платежам.</p>\r\n<h2>При успешной транзакции возвращается колбэк с ошибкой или не возвращается вообще.</h2>\r\n<p>Операция в ЛК проведена успешно, но колбэк отсутствует или пришел с ошибкой. Это не значит, что транзакция прошла не успешно. В большинстве случаев операция прошла успешно, но из-за технических проблем, банк отправил некорректный ответ на наш сервер или наш сервер некорректно принял ответ.

через систему быстрых платежей.\r\n\r\n    Данный сервис позволяет проверить следующие данные: ФИО, серия и номер паспорта, ИНН, СНИЛС, номер полиса ОМС, пол, дата рождения, а также производить авторизацию заемщиков через портал Госуслуг.\r\n    \r\n    Удаленная идентификация - это механизм, позволяющий россиянам получать финансовые услуги дистанционно в различных финансовых учреждениях, подтвердив свою личность с помощью биометрических персональных данных. \r\n    \r\n    Сервис для микрофинансовых и других кредитных организаций VEPAY по верификации карты клиента и упрощенной идентификации позволит компании ускорить время принятия решения по выдаче займа и его зачисления на банковскую карту заемщика, снизить количество мошеннических операций, актуализировать информацию по действующим клиентам и выявить дополнительные данные в режиме онлайн. \r\n    \r\n    VEPAY обеспечивает помощь в интеграции, а также оказывает техническую поддержку по возникающим вопросам.\r\n
